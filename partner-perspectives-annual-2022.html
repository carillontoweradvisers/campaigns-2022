                        <p><strong>About Carillon Tower Advisers</strong></p>

                            wide range of disciplines and investing vehicles, is the best way to help investors seek
                            their long-term financial goals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Risk Considerations</strong></p>
                        <p>Investing involves risk, including risk of loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or
                            guarantee against loss.</p>
                        <p>Historically, bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital
                            than has equity investing. However, there are many factors which may affect the risk and
                            return profile of a fixed-income portfolio. The two most prominent factors are interest-rate
                            movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer. The risk of a change in the market
                            value of the investment due to changes in interest rates is known as interest-rate risk.
                            Interest-rate risk is subject to many variables but may be analyzed based on various data
                            (e.g., effective duration). The risk that the issuer may default on interest and/or
                            principal payments is often referred to as credit risk. Credit risk is typically measured by
                            ratings issued by ratings agencies such as Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s®. Bonds issued
                            by the U.S. Government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by
                            corporations and municipalities (see below for a discussion of the risk associated with
                            convertible securities). However, the overall return on Government bonds tends to be less
                            than these other types of fixed-income securities. Finally, reinvestment risk is the
                            possibility that the proceeds of a maturing investment must be invested in a lower yielding
                            security, all other things held constant, due to changes in the interest-rate environment.
                            Investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixed-income securities which
                            comprise their portfolio, and remember that, as with all investments, there is the risk of
                            the loss of capital.</p>

                        <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
                        <p>Quantitative easing (QE) is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank
                            purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply
                            and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy,
                            and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also
                            expands the central bank's balance sheet.</p>
                        <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices paid by consumers for goods and
                            services. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics bases the index on prices of food, clothing,
                            shelter, fuels, transportation, doctors’ and dentists’ services, drugs, and other goods and
                            services that people buy for day-to-day living. Prices are collected each month in 75 urban
                            areas across the country from about 6,000 households and 22,000 retailers.</p>
                        <p>Core inflation is measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) excluding Food and
                            Energy, Price Index, also known as the core PCE price index, is a measure of the prices that
                            U.S. consumers pay for goods and services, not including two categories – food and energy –
                            where prices tend to swing up and down more dramatically and more often than other prices.
                            The core PCE price index, released monthly by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of
                            Economic Analysis, measures inflation trends and is watched closely by the U.S. Federal
                            Reserve as it conducts monetary policy.</p>
                        <p>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is a heterodox macroeconomic theory that, for countries with
                            complete control over their own fiat currency, government spending cannot be thought of like
                            a household budget. Instead of thinking of taxes as income and government spending as
                            expenses in a checkbook, MMT proponents say that fiscal policy is merely a representation of
                            how much money the government is putting into the economy or taking out.</p>
                        <p>Basis points(bps) are measurements used in discussions of interest rates and other
                            percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%.</p>
                        <p>Duration incorporates a bond’s yield, coupon, final maturity and call features into one
                            number, expressed in years, that indicates how price-sensitive a bond or portfolio is to
                            changes in interest rates. Bonds with higher durations carry more risk and have higher price
                            volatility than bonds with lower durations.</p>
                        <p>Growth investing is an investment strategy that focuses on companies expected to grow at an
                            above-average rate compared to their industry or the market.</p>
                        <p>Unconstrained investing is an investing style that allows a fund or portfolio manager to
                            pursue returns across many asset classes and sectors without limiting the portfolio to
                            investments that match a particular benchmark.</p>
                        <p>Cyclical securities have prices influenced by macroeconomic changes in the economy and are
                            known for following the economy as it cycles through expansion, peak, recession, and
                            recovery.</p>

                                <p>Supply chain bottlenecks that bedeviled the global economy in 2021 appear to be
                                    easing, at least at the margins. No one expects that supply chain disruptions to
                                    fade away soon, but resolving the problems could create opportunity for investors.

                                    <li>Despite signs of improvement, semiconductor inventories remain low and are not
                                        expected to recover until the second half of 2022 – and likely not until 2023
                                        for automotive chips.</li>
                                    <li>Supply chains were under stress even before the pandemic, with fleets of aging
                                        trucks and a shrinking pool of drivers. Like everywhere else, labor is key.</li>
                                    <li>Potential investor opportunities include capital expenditure, especially for
                                        automation, and real estate investment trusts focused on warehouses that shorten
                                        the supply chain.</li>

                        <p>Carillon Tower Advisers is a global asset management company that combines the exceptional
                            insight and agility of individual investment teams with the strength and stability of a
                            full-service firm. Together with our partner affiliates — ClariVest Asset Management, Cougar
                            Global Investments, Eagle Asset Management, Reams Asset Management (a division of Scout
                            Investments), and Scout Investments — we offer a range of investment strategies and asset
                            classes, each with a focus on risk-adjusted returns and alpha generation. Carillon Tower
                            Advisers believes providing a lineup of institutional-class portfolio managers, spanning a
                            wide range of disciplines and investing vehicles, is the best way to help investors seek
                            their long-term financial goals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Risk Considerations</strong></p>

                        <p>Investing involves risk, including risk of loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or
                            guarantee against loss.</p>
                        <p>Investing in small-sized companies is based on the premise that relatively small companies
                            will increase their earnings and grow into larger, more valuable companies. However, as with
                            all equity investing, there is the risk that a company will not achieve its expected
                            earnings results, or that an unexpected change in the market or within the company will
                            occur, both of which may adversely affect investment results. Historically, small-cap stocks
                            have experienced greater volatility than other equity asset classes, and they may be less
                            liquid than larger cap stocks. Thus, relative to larger, more liquid stocks, investing in
                            small-cap stocks involves potentially greater volatility and risk. The biggest risk of
                            equity investing is that returns can fluctuate and investors can lose money.</p>

                        <p><strong>Risk considerations</strong></p>

                        <p>Investing involves risk, including risk of loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or
                            guarantee against loss.</p>
                        <p>Historically, bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital
                            than has equity investing. However, there are many factors which may affect the risk and
                            return profile of a fixed-income portfolio. The two most prominent factors are interest-rate
                            movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer. The risk of a change in the market
                            value of the investment due to changes in interest rates is known as interest-rate risk.
                            Interest-rate risk is subject to many variables but may be analyzed based on various data
                            (e.g., effective duration). The risk that the issuer may default on interest and/or
                            principal payments is often referred to as credit risk. Credit risk is typically measured by
                            ratings issued by ratings agencies such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Bonds issued
                            by the U.S. Government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by
                            corporations and municipalities (see below for a discussion of the risk associated with
                            convertible securities). However, the overall return on Government bonds tends to be less
                            than these other types of fixed-income securities. Finally, reinvestment risk is the
                            possibility that the proceeds of a maturing investment must be invested in a lower yielding
                            security, all other things held constant, due to changes in the interest-rate environment.
                            Investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixed-income securities which
                            comprise their portfolio, and remember that, as with all investments, there is the risk of
                            the loss of capital.</p>
                        <p>The investment strategy will include only holdings deemed consistent with the applicable
                            Environmental Social Governance (ESG) guidelines. As a result, the universe of investments
                            available to the strategy will be more limited than strategies not applying such guidelines,
                            which may cause it to perform differently than similar strategies that do not have such a
                            policy.</p>

                        <p>Alpha is a measure of the difference between an investment manager's actual returns and its
                            expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by Beta. A positive Alpha figure
                            indicates the manager has performed better than its Beta would predict. A negative Alpha
                            indicates the manager performed worse than expected based on its level of risk. Thus it is
                            possible for a manager to outperform an index and still have a negative Alpha. In general,
                            however, the higher the Alpha the better.</p>
                        <p>Beta is a measure of a manager's sensitivity to market movements. In general, the larger the
                            Beta, the more volatile the historical performance.</p>

                        <p><strong>About Carillon Tower Advisers</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Risk Considerations</strong></p>

                        <p>Investing involves risk, including risk of loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or
                            guarantee against loss.</p>
                        <p>International investing presents specific risks, such as currency fluctuations, differences
                            in financial accounting standards, and potential political and economic instability. These
                            risks are further accentuated in emerging market countries, where risks can also include
                            possible economic dependency on revenues from particular commodities or on international aid
                            or development assistance, currency transfer restrictions, and liquidity risks related to
                            lower trading volumes.</p>
                        <p>Investments in equities are subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or
                            long periods of time. In the past, the equity markets have moved in cycles, and the value of
                            a client's equity securities may fluctuate drastically from day to day. Investing in foreign
                            securities poses additional market risks since political and economic events unique in a
                            country or region will affect those markets and their issuers. As a result, investments in
                            foreign securities may experience greater volatility than U.S. securities. These securities
                            may be traded over-the-counter or listed on an exchange. Accounts are included in the
                            composite once they are fully transitioned to our investment strategy. As of January 1,
                            2021, the Emerging Markets composite was renamed the Emerging Markets Non-Restricted
                            composite.</p>
                        <p>Historically, bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital
                            than has equity investing. However, there are many factors which may affect the risk and
                            return profile of a fixed-income portfolio. The two most prominent factors are interest-rate
                            movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer. The risk of a change in the market
                            value of the investment due to changes in interest rates is known as interest-rate risk.
                            Interest-rate risk is subject to many variables but may be analyzed based on various data
                            (e.g., effective duration). The risk that the issuer may default on interest and/or
                            principal payments is often referred to as credit risk. Credit risk is typically measured by
                            ratings issued by ratings agencies such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Bonds issued
                            by the U.S. Government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by
                            corporations and municipalities (see below for a discussion of the risk associated with
                            convertible securities). However, the overall return on Government bonds tends to be less
                            than these other types of fixed-income securities. Finally, reinvestment risk is the
                            possibility that the proceeds of a maturing investment must be invested in a lower yielding
                            security, all other things held constant, due to changes in the interest-rate environment.
                            Investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixed-income securities which
                            comprise their portfolio, and remember that, as with all investments, there is the risk of
                            the loss of capital.</p>
                        <p>The investment strategy will include only holdings deemed consistent with the applicable
                            Environmental Social Governance (ESG) guidelines. As a result, the universe of investments
                            available to the strategy will be more limited than strategies not applying such guidelines,
                            which may cause it to perform differently than similar strategies that do not have such a
                            policy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
                        <p>Growth investing is a stock-buying strategy that focuses on companies expected to grow at an
                            above-average rate compared to their industry or the market.</p>
                        <p>Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be
                            trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.</p>
                        <p>Foreign exchange (forex or FX) is the trading of one currency for another.</p>
                        <p>Quantitative easing (QE) is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank
                            purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply
                            and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy,
                            and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also
                            expands the central bank's balance sheet.</p>
                        <p>Beta is a measure of the volatility or systemic risk of a security or portfolio compared with
                            the market as a whole.</p>
                        <p>A credit spread is the difference in yield between a U.S. Treasury bond and another debt
                            security with the same maturity but different credit quality. Also referred to as "bond
                            spreads" or "default spreads," credit spreads are measured in basis points, with a 1%
                            difference in yield equaling a spread of 100 basis points. Credit spreads reflect the risk
                            of the debt security being compared with the Treasury bond, which is considered to be
                            risk-free. Higher quality securities have a lower chance of the issuer defaulting. Lower
                            quality securities have a higher chance of the issuer defaulting.</p>

                        <p><strong>About Carillon Tower Advisers</strong></p>
                        <p>Carillon Tower Advisers is a global asset management company that combines the exceptional
                            insight and agility of individual investment teams with the strength and stability of a
                            full-service firm. Together with our partner affiliates - ClariVest Asset Management, Cougar
                            Global Investments, Eagle Asset Management, Reams Asset Management (a division of Scout
                            Investments), and Scout Investments - we offer a range of investment strategies and asset
                            classes, each with a focus on risk-adjusted returns and alpha generation. Carillon Tower
                            Advisers believes providing a lineup of institutional-class portfolio managers, spanning a
                            wide range of disciplines and investing vehicles, is the best way to help investors seek
                            their long-term financial goals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Risk Considerations</strong></p>

                        <p>Investing involves risk, including risk of loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or
                            guarantee against loss.</p>
                        <p>Investments in small-cap companies generally involve greater risks than investing in larger
                            capitalization companies. Small-cap companies often have narrower commercial markets and
                            more limited managerial and financial resources than larger, more established companies. As
                            a result, their performance can be more volatile and they face greater risk of business
                            failure, which could increase the volatility of a fund's portfolio. Additionally, small-cap
                            companies may have less market liquidity than larger companies.</p>
                        <p>Growth companies are expected to increase their earnings at a certain rate. When these
                            expectations are not met, investors may punish the stocks excessively, even if earnings
                            showed an absolute increase. Growth company stocks also typically lack the dividend yield
                            that can cushion stock prices in market downturns.</p>
                        <p>Value investing is based on the potential for a company's stock price to rise based upon
                            anticipated changes in the market or within the company itself. Value stocks have
                            historically been sensitive to economic cycles and investor sentiment that can affect
                            volatility and risk.</p>

                            above-average rate compared to their industry or the market.</p>
                        <p>Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be
                            trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.</p>
                        <p>A yield curve is a line that plots yields (interest rates) of bonds having equal credit
                            quality but differing maturity dates. The slope of the yield curve gives an idea of future
                            interest rate changes and economic activity.</p>
                        <p>The "2s/10s" is a bellwether indicator that tracks the spread between the 10-year U.S.
                            Treasury bond and the 2-year Treasury note.</p>
                        <p>Duration incorporates a bond's yield, coupon, final maturity and call features into one
                            number, expressed in years, that indicates how price-sensitive a bond or portfolio is to
                            changes in interest rates. Bonds with higher durations carry more risk and have higher price
                            volatility than bonds with lower durations.</p>
                        <p>Concept stocks are defined as having a price-to-sales ratio greater than 5. The large size of
                            the ratio suggests that investors may be attracted to the idea, promise, or concept of a
                            company in the absence of other common value metrics. Concept stocks often have little or no
                            earnings, making the more traditional price-to-earnings ratio difficult to apply.</p>
                        <p>Beta is a measure of the volatility or systemic risk of a security or portfolio compared with
                            the market as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Short sellers bet that the price of an asset will decline in value. To profit off that drop,
                            they agree to buy shares of the asset at a predetermined price on a set expiration date. In
                            the meantime, they borrow shares of the asset to sell at the prevailing higher price with
                            the expectation that they will be able to buy them later at the lower price attached to the
                            expiration date.</p>
                        <p>The S&amp;P 500&#174; Index measures change in stock market conditions based on the average
                            performance of 500 widely held common stocks. It is a market-weighted index calculated on a
                            total return basis with dividend reinvested. The S&amp;P 500 represents approximately 75% of
                            the investable U.S. equity market.</p>
                        <p>The Russell 1000&#174; Index is a subset of the Russell 3000&#174; Index. It represents the
                            top companies by market capitalization. The Russell 1000 typically comprises approximately
                            90% of the total market capitalization of all listed U.S. stocks. It is considered a
                            bellwether index for large-cap investing.</p>
                        <p>The Russell 2000&#174; Index measures the performance of the 2,000 smallest companies in the
                            Russell 3000&#174; Index, which represents approximately 8% of the total market
                            capitalization of the Russell 3000&#174; Index.</p>
                        <p>The Russell 2000&#174; Growth Index measures the performance of the small-cap growth segment
                            of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 2000 companies with higher
                            price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values.</p>
                        <p>The Russell 2000&#174; Value Index measures the performance of the small-cap value segment of
                            the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 2000 companies with lower price-to-book
                            ratios and lower forecasted growth values.</p>

                        <p><strong>Risk Considerations</strong></p>

                        <p>Investing involves risk, including risk of loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or
                            guarantee against loss.</p>
                        <p>Investments in small-cap companies generally involve greater risks than investing in larger
                            capitalization companies. Small-cap companies often have narrower commercial markets and
                            more limited managerial and financial resources than larger, more established companies. As
                            a result, their performance can be more volatile and they face greater risk of business
                            failure, which could increase the volatility of a fund's portfolio. Additionally, small-cap
                            companies may have less market liquidity than larger companies.</p>
                        <p>Growth companies are expected to increase their earnings at a certain rate. When these
                            expectations are not met, investors may punish the stocks excessively, even if earnings
                            showed an absolute increase. Growth company stocks also typically lack the dividend yield
                            that can cushion stock prices in market downturns.</p>
                        <p>Value investing is based on the potential for a company's stock price to rise based upon
                            anticipated changes in the market or within the company itself. Value stocks have
                            historically been sensitive to economic cycles and investor sentiment that can affect
                            volatility and risk.</p>
                        <p>Historically, bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital
                            than has equity investing. However, there are many factors which may affect the risk and
                            return profile of a fixed-income portfolio. The two most prominent factors are interest-rate
                            movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer. The risk of a change in the market
                            value of the investment due to changes in interest rates is known as interest-rate risk.
                            Interest-rate risk is subject to many variables but may be analyzed based on various data
                            (e.g., effective duration). The risk that the issuer may default on interest and/or
                            principal payments is often referred to as credit risk. Credit risk is typically measured by
                            ratings issued by ratings agencies such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Bonds issued
                            by the U.S. Government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by
                            corporations and municipalities (see below for a discussion of the risk associated with
                            convertible securities). However, the overall return on Government bonds tends to be less
                            than these other types of fixed-income securities. Finally, reinvestment risk is the
                            possibility that the proceeds of a maturing investment must be invested in a lower yielding
                            security, all other things held constant, due to changes in the interest-rate environment.
                            Investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixed-income securities which
                            comprise their portfolio, and remember that, as with all investments, there is the risk of
                            the loss of capital.</p>
                        <p>The investment strategy will include only holdings deemed consistent with the applicable
                            Environmental Social Governance (ESG) guidelines. As a result, the universe of investments
                            available to the strategy will be more limited than strategies not applying such guidelines,
                            which may cause it to perform differently than similar strategies that do not have such a
                            policy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
                        <p>Alpha is a measure of the difference between an investment manager's actual returns and its
                            expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by Beta. A positive Alpha figure
                            indicates the manager has performed better than its Beta would predict. A negative Alpha
                            indicates the manager performed worse than expected based on its level of risk. Thus it is
                            possible for a manager to outperform an index and still have a negative Alpha. In general,
                            however, the higher the Alpha the better.</p>
                        <p>Beta is a measure of a manager's sensitivity to market movements. In general, the larger the
                            Beta, the more volatile the historical performance.</p>
                        <p>An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks a market index, sector,
                            commodity, or other assets, but which can be bought or sold on a stock exchange the same way
                            a regular stock or other security can. An ETF can be structured to track a wide variety of
                            securities, including stocks, bonds, individual commodities, diverse aggregations of
                            securities, and specific investment strategies.</p>
                        <p>Equity duration is the cash-flow weighted average time at which investors can expect to
                            receive the cash flows from their investment in a company's stock. Long-duration stocks
                            include fast-growing technology companies, including those that may not pay any dividends in
                            their early years, while short-duration stocks tend to be more mature companies with higher
                            ratios to dividend to price.</p>
